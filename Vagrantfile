#   # NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port

#   # within the machine from a port on the host machine and only allow access
#   # via 127.0.0.1 to disable public access
#   # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"

#   #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
#   #   vb.gui = true
#   #
#   #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
#   #   vb.memory = "1024"
#   # end
#   #
#   # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
#   # information on available options.

#   # Enable provisioning with a shell script. Additional provisioners such as
#   # Ansible, Chef, Docker, Puppet and Salt are also available. Please see the
#   # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
#   # config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
